# Terminology

## webAI Terminology

### Canvas
**Canvas** is the main workspace of Navigator. It is the creation area where you can train, test, and prototype AI models.

### Drawer
The **Drawer** is where the library of Elements is stored.

### Element
**Elements** are the building blocks within Navigator. An Element is a package of code designed to perform a specific function—such as training an AI model or visualizing a running flow.

### Flow
A **Flow** is a sequence of connected Elements that work t sogether to perform a trained function and deliver an output. A basic Flow typically includes:
- an **Input Element**
- an **AI Inference Element**
- an **Output Element**

### Deployment
A **Deployment** allows users to assign Flows to a set of computers and input devices. It decouples a running Flow from the Navigator UI, enabling it to operate independently.

## Terminology

### Object Detector
An **Object Detector** is a computer vision model that identifies and localizes specific objects in images or videos. It can detect multiple objects simultaneously by drawing bounding boxes around them.

### Classifier
A **Classifier** is an AI model that categorizes input data into predefined classes based on patterns and features within the data.

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a powerful AI model trained on vast text corpora. It generates human-like, coherent, and context-aware responses—ideal for natural language processing tasks.

### AI Model Training
**AI Model Training** is the process of teaching an AI model to recognize patterns using large datasets. The model learns features and relationships to make accurate predictions or generate outputs.

### AI Model Inference
**AI Model Inference** involves using a trained model to make predictions or generate outputs from new, unseen data. It applies learned patterns to deliver results in real-time.

### Bounding Box
A **Bounding Box** is a rectangular outline that visually highlights the location of an object in an image or video—commonly used in object detection.

### Model Confidence
**Model Confidence** reflects the AI model’s certainty about its prediction or output. Higher confidence means the model is more certain of its result.

### Model Accuracy
**Model Accuracy** measures how well an AI model performs. It’s the percentage of correct predictions out of the total attempts—higher accuracy means better performance.

### Computer Vision
**Computer Vision** is a branch of AI focused on understanding visual data like images and videos. It enables machines to interpret and extract meaningful insights from visual inputs.
